### Usage

```
Usage: main [OPTIONS] [OWNER] [REPO]

Arguments:
  [OWNER]
          GitHub repository owner or organization (for example: `rust-lang`).

          This is required unless `--print-log-dir` or `--set-token` is provided.

  [REPO]
          GitHub repository name under `owner` (for example: `rust`).

          This is required unless `--print-log-dir` or `--set-token` is provided.

Options:
  -l, --log-level <LOG_LEVEL>
          Global logging verbosity used by the application logger.

          Defaults to `info`.

          [default: info]
          [possible values: trace, debug, info, warn, error, none]

  -p, --print-log-dir
          Prints the directory where log files are written and exits

  -s, --set-token <SET_TOKEN>
          Stores/updates the GitHub token in the configured credential store.

          When provided, this command updates the saved token value.

  -h, --help
          Print help (see a summary with '-h')

  -V, --version
          Print version
```

See [KEYBINDINGS.md](./KEYBINDS.md) for a list of keybindings used in the application.

### Token Security

`gitv` uses the `keyring` crate to securely store your GitHub token in your system's credential store. This means that your token is encrypted and protected by your operating system's security features, providing a secure way to manage your authentication credentials.
