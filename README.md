### Usage

```
Usage: gitv [OPTIONS] [OWNER] [REPO]

Arguments:
  [OWNER]
          GitHub repository owner or organization (for example: `rust-lang`).

          This is required unless `--print-log-dir` or `--set-token` is provided.

  [REPO]
          GitHub repository name under `owner` (for example: `rust`).

          This is required unless `--print-log-dir` or `--set-token` is provided.

Options:
  -l, --log-level <LOG_LEVEL>
          Global logging verbosity used by the application logger.

          Defaults to `info`.

          [default: info]
          [possible values: trace, debug, info, warn, error, none]

  -p, --print-log-dir
          Prints the directory where log files are written and exits

  -s, --set-token <SET_TOKEN>
          Stores/updates the GitHub token in the configured credential store.

          When provided, this command updates the saved token value.

      --generate-man
          Generate man pages using clap-mangen and exit

  -h, --help
          Print help (see a summary with '-h')

  -V, --version
          Print version
```

See [KEYBINDINGS.md](./KEYBINDS.md) for a list of keybindings used in the application.

### Token Security

> [!NOTE]
> To persist the token across reboots (i.e. to store it on disk) on Linux, build with the `persist-token` feature flag. This requires for `dbus` to be present and `DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS` to be set.

`gitv` uses the `keyring` crate to securely store your GitHub token in your system's credential store. This means that your token is encrypted and protected by your operating system's security features, providing a secure way to manage your authentication credentials.

### Contributing

Contributions to `gitv` are welcome! If you have an idea for a new feature or have found a bug, please open an issue or submit a pull request on the GitHub repository.

> [!TIP]
> Run the `init.py` initialization script to set up your development environment. It installs a pre-push hook that runs `typos` and `clippy` to help maintain code quality and consistency. Ensure that you have the `typos-cli` installed and available in your PATH for the pre-push hook to work correctly. You can install it using `cargo install typos-cli`.

`gitv` is dual-licensed under the MIT License and the Unlicense, at your option. See the [MIT](./LICENSE-MIT) and [Unlicense](./UNLICENSE) for more information.
