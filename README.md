> Following in the footsteps of the `g`lobal `r`egex `e`xpression `p`rint `grep`, I introduce to you `g`ithub `i`ssues `t`ui `v`iewer `gitv`.

`gitv` is a terminal-based viewer for GitHub issues. It allows you to view and manage your GitHub issues directly from the terminal.

### Installation

#### Homebrew (macOS)

```bash
brew install jayanaxhf/taps/gitv
```

#### Using Cargo

```bash
cargo install --locked gitv-tui
```

#### From Source

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jayanaxhf/gitv.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd gitv
```

3. Build the project:

```bash
cargo install --path .
```

#### NixOS

<details>
  <summary>Flake</summary>

  First add the repository to your inputs.

  Point to main branch:
  
  ```nix
  inputs = {
      ...
      gitv.url = "github:JayanAXHF/gitv";
      ...
  };
  ```

  Point to a rev in main branch:

  ```nix
  inputs = {
      ...
      gitv.url = "github:JayanAXHF/gitv/d70273b05c5e80b05446e4aa0847758e54435d62";
      ...
  };
  ```

  Point to a tag:

  ```nix
  inputs = {
      ...
      gitv.url = "github:JayanAXHF/gitv/refs/tags/gitv-tui-v0.3.2";
      ...
  };
  ```
    
  Then your outputs should look something like this:
  
  ```nix
  outputs = {...} @ inputs: { 
    # Don't forget to add nixpkgs to your inputs
    nixosConfigurations."nixos" = inputs.nixpkgs.lib.nixosSystem {
      ...
      specialArgs = {inherit inputs;};
      modules = [
        ./configuration.nix
        ... 
      ];
    };
  };
  ```
  
  And finally, somewhere in your `configuration.nix`:
  
  ```nix
  {inputs, pkgs, ...}: {
    ...
    environment.systemPackages = [
      inputs.gitv.packages.${pkgs.stdenv.hostPlatform.system}.default
    ];
    ...
  }
  ```
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Non-Flake</summary>
  
  ##### Pinning Tool
  
  First add the pin using your pinning tool.

  We are going to show examples using npins.

  Point to a branch:
  
  ```bash
  npins add github JayanAXHF gitv -b main
  ```

  Point to a rev in main branch:

  ```bash
  npins add github JayanAXHF gitv -b main --at d70273b05c5e80b05446e4aa0847758e54435d62
  ```

  Point to a tag:

  ```bash
  npins add github JayanAXHF gitv --at gitv-tui-v0.3.2
  ```

  Or point to latest release:

  ```bash
  npins add github JayanAXHF gitv
  ```
  
  Then add the package to your `systemPackages`:
  
  ```nix
  let
    sources = import ./npins;
  in {
    environment.systemPackages = [
      (import sources.gitv)
    ];
  }
  ```
  
  ##### No Pinning Tool
  
  ```nix
  let
    rev = "d70273b05c5e80b05446e4aa0847758e54435d62";
    gitv = import (fetchTarball "https://github.com/JayanAXHF/gitv/archive/${rev}.tar.gz") {};
  in {
    environment.systemPackages = [
      gitv
    ];
  }
  ```
</details>

### Usage

```
Usage: gitv [OPTIONS] [OWNER] [REPO]

Arguments:
  [OWNER]
          GitHub repository owner or organization (for example: `rust-lang`).

          This is required unless `--print-log-dir` or `--set-token` is provided.

  [REPO]
          GitHub repository name under `owner` (for example: `rust`).

          This is required unless `--print-log-dir` or `--set-token` is provided.

Options:
  -l, --log-level <LOG_LEVEL>
          Global logging verbosity used by the application logger.

          Defaults to `info`.

          [default: info]
          [possible values: trace, debug, info, warn, error, none]

  -p, --print-log-dir
          Prints the directory where log files are written and exits

  -s, --set-token <SET_TOKEN>
          Stores/updates the GitHub token in the configured credential store.

          When provided, this command updates the saved token value.

      --generate-man
          Generate man pages using clap-mangen and exit

  -e, --env
          When provided, this command will read the GitHub token from the environment variable

  -h, --help
          Print help (see a summary with '-h')

  -V, --version
          Print version
```

See [KEYBINDINGS.md](./KEYBINDS.md) for a list of keybindings used in the application.

### Token Security

> [!NOTE]
> To persist the token across reboots (i.e. to store it on disk) on Linux, build with the `persist-token` feature flag. This requires for `dbus` to be present and `DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS` to be set.

`gitv` uses the `keyring` crate to securely store your GitHub token in your system's credential store. This means that your token is encrypted and protected by your operating system's security features, providing a secure way to manage your authentication credentials.

### Contributing

Contributions to `gitv` are welcome! If you have an idea for a new feature or have found a bug, please open an issue or submit a pull request on the GitHub repository.

> [!TIP]
> Run the `init.py` initialization script to set up your development environment. It installs a pre-push hook that runs `typos` and `clippy` to help maintain code quality and consistency. Ensure that you have the `typos-cli` installed and available in your PATH for the pre-push hook to work correctly. You can install it using `cargo install typos-cli`.

 [!TIP]
> If you're using nix then you can use the provided devshell to get your development environment up and running, it also includes the pre-push hook provided. You can do so by executing `direnv allow` or `nix develop`.
